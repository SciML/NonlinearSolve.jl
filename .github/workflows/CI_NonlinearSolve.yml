  # NOTE: Downgrade tests are temporarily disabled because NonlinearSolve's
  # [compat] bounds require versions of local packages that aren't registered yet.
  #
  # Root cause: NonlinearSolve requires unreleased versions of its subpackages:
  #   - SimpleNonlinearSolve: requires 2.11, registry has 2.9.0
  #   - NonlinearSolveFirstOrder: requires 1.11, registry has 1.10.0
  #   - NonlinearSolveQuasiNewton: requires 1.12, registry has 1.11.0
  #
  # Resolver.jl (used by julia-downgrade-compat) only uses registry versions,
  # ignoring [sources] entries. When it can't find versions satisfying compat
  # bounds, resolution fails with:
  #   KeyError: key UUID("727e6d20-b764-4bd8-a329-72de5adea6c7") not found
  #
  # Fix: Register the new versions of subpackages to General registry.
  # After registration, downgrade tests should work again.
  #
  # TODO: Re-enable once subpackage versions are registered
