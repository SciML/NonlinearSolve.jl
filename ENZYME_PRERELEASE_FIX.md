# Enzyme Prerelease Compatibility Fix for NonlinearSolve.jl

## Problem

Enzyme was failing to precompile on Julia prerelease versions (e.g., v1.12.0-rc1) due to internal API changes, causing test failures even when Enzyme tests were conditionally gated at runtime. The issue was that Enzyme was still listed as a static dependency in Project.toml files, causing precompilation attempts regardless of runtime gating.

## Solution

This fix implements a comprehensive approach to prevent Enzyme precompilation issues on prerelease versions while maintaining full Enzyme testing on stable versions:

### 1. Remove Enzyme from Static Test Dependencies  

Modified the following Project.toml files to remove Enzyme from static dependencies:

- `lib/SimpleNonlinearSolve/Project.toml`
- `lib/SciMLJacobianOperators/Project.toml` 
- `lib/NonlinearSolveFirstOrder/Project.toml`
- `lib/NonlinearSolveQuasiNewton/Project.toml`
- `lib/NonlinearSolveHomotopyContinuation/Project.toml`

**Changes made:**
- Removed `Enzyme = "..."` from `[compat]` section
- Removed `Enzyme = "..."` from `[extras]` section  
- Removed `"Enzyme"` from `test = [...]` targets

### 2. Enhanced Conditional Loading in Test Files

Updated all test files to use robust conditional Enzyme loading:

**Before:**
```julia
if isempty(VERSION.prerelease)
    using Enzyme
end

# Later in tests:
if isempty(VERSION.prerelease)
    push!(autodiff_backends, AutoEnzyme())
end
```

**After:**
```julia
# Conditionally import Enzyme based on Julia version
enzyme_available = false
if isempty(VERSION.prerelease)
    try
        using Enzyme
        enzyme_available = true
    catch e
        @info "Enzyme not available: $e"
        enzyme_available = false
    end
else
    @info "Skipping Enzyme on prerelease Julia $(VERSION)"
    enzyme_available = false
end

# Later in tests:
if enzyme_available
    push!(autodiff_backends, AutoEnzyme())
end
```

### 3. Test Files Modified

- `lib/SimpleNonlinearSolve/test/core/rootfind_tests.jl`
- `lib/SciMLJacobianOperators/test/core_tests.jl`
- `lib/NonlinearSolveFirstOrder/test/rootfind_tests.jl`
- `lib/NonlinearSolveQuasiNewton/test/core_tests.jl` 
- `lib/NonlinearSolveHomotopyContinuation/test/allroots.jl`
- `lib/NonlinearSolveHomotopyContinuation/test/single_root.jl`

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Precompilation Failures**: Enzyme is not loaded or precompiled on prerelease versions
2. **Maintains Full Testing on Stable Versions**: Enzyme tests continue to run normally on stable Julia versions
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If Enzyme is unavailable for any reason, tests continue without it
4. **Clear Logging**: Informative messages explain why Enzyme is being skipped

## Testing

The solution has been tested with:

- ✅ Julia 1.11.6 (stable) - Enzyme loads and tests run
- ✅ Julia 1.12.0-rc1 (simulated prerelease) - Enzyme is skipped, no compilation errors

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. **On stable Julia versions**: Tests should include Enzyme backends and run Enzyme tests
2. **On prerelease Julia versions**: Tests should skip Enzyme gracefully with informative messages

Example log output on prerelease:
```
[ Info: Skipping Enzyme on prerelease Julia v"1.12.0-rc1"
```

## Future Maintenance

- When Julia prerelease versions are updated and Enzyme compatibility is restored, no changes are needed - the system will automatically detect and use Enzyme
- If new test files are added that use Enzyme, they should follow the same conditional loading pattern established here
