Pseudo-arclength continuation solver for a `SciMLBase.HomotopyProblem`. Unlike
[`HomotopySweep`](@ref), which marches the scalar parameter ``λ`` monotonically, this
solver tracks the solution curve ``H(u, λ) = 0`` parameterized by arclength ``s`` in the
augmented ``(u, λ)`` space. Each step takes a predictor step along the path and corrects
it by solving the *augmented* ``(n+1)``-dimensional system

```
H(u, λ)                 = 0          # n equations
τ ⋅ ([u; λ] - x₀) - Δs  = 0          # Keller pseudo-arclength constraint
```

with the `inner` solver. Because ``λ`` is a free variable of the corrector (not held
fixed), the augmented Jacobian stays nonsingular at *turning points* (folds) where
``∂H/∂u`` is singular and ``λ`` is non-monotone along the path. This lets the solver
round folds that defeat natural-parameter continuation — the canonical reason a sweep
"fails to reach `λ = 1`" when a real solution at `λ = 1` does exist but only on a branch
reachable by going around a fold.

The target is the point on the curve where ``λ = λspan[2]``: the solver follows the path
until a step brackets that ``λ``, then performs one final ``λ``-fixed correction to land
on it exactly.

Optional derivative fields of the problem's `NonlinearFunction` (which follow the same
λ-extended argument convention as the residual) are consumed. An analytic
`jac(u, p, λ)` / `jac(J, u, p, λ)` supplies the ``∂H/∂u`` block of the augmented path
Jacobian ``[∂H/∂u | ∂H/∂λ]``; the missing ``∂H/∂λ`` column is a *scalar-parameter*
derivative, obtained as one forward-mode derivative of the residual in ``λ`` at fixed
`u` (through `autodiff`) — the packed system is never differentiated wholesale. The
assembled path Jacobian drives the `:tangent` predictor and, extended by the
analytically known θ-weighted Keller constraint row, gives every augmented corrector
solve a full analytic ``(n+1)×(n+1)`` Jacobian; the λ-fixed anchor and landing solves
consume the jac exactly as [`HomotopySweep`](@ref) does. A `jac_prototype` (or matrix
`sparsity`) is extended to the augmented shapes: one structurally dense ``∂H/∂λ``
column for the predictor's ``n×(n+1)`` system, plus the structurally dense constraint
row for the corrector's bordered ``(n+1)×(n+1)`` system. Sparse and structured
prototypes are promoted to `SparseMatrixCSC` — a bordered `Tridiagonal` is no longer
tridiagonal, and CSC is the general container the coloring and sparse linear-solve
machinery handle; this requires `SparseArrays` to be loaded (structured prototypes
fall back to a dense bordered prototype otherwise), and the prototype is not
eltype-promoted with λ. A sparsity *detector* is forwarded unchanged (it detects the
augmented pattern from the augmented residual itself). A user `colorvec` is forwarded
to the predictor's system extended by one fresh color for the dense λ column; it is
not forwarded to the corrector, whose dense constraint row admits no nontrivial column
coloring — there the bordered prototype's value is chiefly the sparse linear solve.
When no derivative fields are present, construction is identical to before.

!!! note "The arclength metric is θ-weighted"

    All of the solver's path geometry — the Keller constraint row, the predictor
    normalization and orientation, the realized chord length, and the bend-angle test —
    is measured in the weighted inner product

    ```
    ⟨(u₁, λ₁), (u₂, λ₂)⟩_θ = (θ/n)⋅⟨u₁, u₂⟩ + (1 - θ)⋅λ₁λ₂,       n = length(u)
    ```

    (the `DotTheta` convention of BifurcationKit.jl). The `1/n` normalization makes the
    balance between the state block and the parameter independent of the system size: in
    the plain Euclidean dot on `[u; λ]` the ``n`` state components swamp the single ``λ``
    component for large systems, distorting the constraint and the angle test. A
    consequence is that `ds` values (`initial_step_factor`, `min_ds`, `max_step_factor`)
    and `max_angle` are measured in this weighted metric, **not** in the Euclidean metric
    on `[u; λ]`: for a pure-``λ`` motion a weighted arclength `ds` corresponds to a
    ``λ``-distance of `ds / sqrt(1 - θ)`, and for a pure-``u`` motion to a Euclidean
    ``u``-distance of `ds / sqrt(θ/n)`. Step-size values tuned against versions that used
    the unweighted metric may need rescaling.

Keyword arguments:

  - `inner`: the inner nonlinear algorithm used for both the initial on-curve correction
    and the augmented corrector; `nothing` selects NonlinearSolve's default polyalgorithm.
    A polyalgorithm inner runs the augmented corrector with best-subalgorithm retention
    (see [`NonlinearSolvePolyAlgorithm`](@ref)): after the first corrector solve
    discovers the winning subalgorithm, each warm-started corrector resumes from it
    instead of re-running the ladder from its start, escalating only when it fails. The
    λ-fixed anchor and landing solves always run the full ladder.
  - `initial_step_factor`: the initial arclength step `Δs` as a fraction of the `λspan`
    width. Must be in `(0, 1]`.
  - `adaptive`: when `true` (default), a corrector failure halves `Δs` and retries from
    the last accepted point (down to a floor of `min_ds`), and `expand_threshold`
    consecutive successes grow `Δs` by `expand_factor` up to `max_step_factor` of the
    span.
  - `min_ds`: the smallest arclength step bisection may reach; `nothing` (default)
    resolves to `sqrt(eps(typeof(λ)))`.
  - `max_step_factor`: the largest arclength step, as a fraction of the `λspan` width.
    Must be in `(0, 1]`.
  - `expand_factor`: the `Δs` growth multiplier after `expand_threshold` consecutive
    successful steps. Must be ≥ 1; `1` disables expansion.
  - `expand_threshold`: consecutive successful steps required before `Δs` is expanded.
    Must be ≥ 1.
  - `max_angle`: the curvature control (radians, in `(0, π]`). A step is *rejected* and
    `Δs` halved when the path direction turns by more than `max_angle` between the
    previous and current accepted segments; `Δs` is only allowed to grow when the turn is
    below `max_angle / 3`. Because the solution curve is smooth in arclength even at a
    fold (the tangent rotates continuously), bounding the per-step turn forces small
    steps *through* a turning point while permitting large steps on straight stretches —
    and it is what prevents the secant predictor from overshooting onto a different branch
    ("path jumping"). This is the analogue of OpenModelica's homotopy bend parameter.
  - `predictor`: how the initial guess for each corrector is extrapolated along the path.
    `:secant` (default) uses the secant through the last two accepted points, bootstrapped
    from a pure-``λ`` step — derivative-free, but the bootstrap step cannot round a fold
    located within the very first step, and it is not curvature-checked. `:tangent`
    instead computes the true path tangent at the current point as the (oriented) null
    vector of the augmented Jacobian ``[∂H/∂u | ∂H/∂λ]``, which stays well-defined at a
    fold (where the tangent is vertical in ``λ``). It is obtained from the bordered
    linear solve ``[J; τ_prevᵀ] t = e_{n+1}`` (one LU factorization per step, sparse
    Jacobians supported), falling back to a dense SVD null-space computation only when
    the bordered matrix is (near-)singular — e.g. exactly at a branch point, or when the
    previous tangent is orthogonal to the path. The tangent is a higher-order predictor
    and is accurate from the first step, so it curvature-checks every step and can round a
    fold at the very start; the cost is one Jacobian factorization per step (see
    `autodiff`). This is the Euler tangent predictor of the classic path trackers and of
    OpenModelica's global homotopy.
  - `autodiff`: the automatic-differentiation backend (an `ADTypes.AbstractADType`) used
    to form the augmented Jacobian for the `:tangent` predictor and, when the problem
    supplies an analytic `jac`, to take the single ``∂H/∂λ`` scalar derivative that
    completes it; `nothing` (default) selects `AutoForwardDiff()`. Unused by the
    `:secant` predictor on problems without an analytic `jac`.
  - `linsolve`: the LinearSolve.jl algorithm for the `:tangent` predictor's bordered
    solve (the same knob the Newton descent methods expose); `nothing` (default) selects
    LinearSolve's default. Unused by the `:secant` predictor.
  - `tracking_maxiters`: iteration cap for the augmented corrector solves (default 10,
    in the range used by MatCont, HomotopyContinuation.jl, and OpenModelica;
    `nothing` disables). A rejected step retries at half the arclength increment from a warm
    start, so failing fast is far cheaper than exhausting the inner solver's full
    budget. Never applied to the anchor or final λ-fixed landing solves; an explicit
    user-passed `maxiters` always wins. On success, step growth is additionally
    scaled by the corrector's iteration count (AUTO-style bands) alongside the
    bend-angle gate.
  - `maxsteps`: a hard cap on the total number of predictor-corrector attempts (including
    bisection retries). Required because the path is *not* monotone in `λ`, so a sweep
    that never reaches the target — a closed loop, or a branch escaping to infinity —
    would otherwise not terminate. Exceeding it returns a `ReturnCode.MaxIters` failure.
  - `theta`: the weight ``θ`` of the arclength metric (see the note above). Must be in
    `(0, 1)`; the default `0.5` weighs the (size-normalized) state block and the
    parameter equally. Larger `theta` emphasizes the state components, smaller `theta`
    emphasizes ``λ``.

When the solver cannot reach `λspan[2]`, the returned solution carries a failure retcode
and its `u` is the last converged curve point.

With the default `:secant` predictor the continuation is derivative-free in the predictor;
the augmented corrector obtains the derivatives it needs through the inner solver's own
differentiation, exactly as a standard `NonlinearProblem` would. The `:tangent` predictor
additionally differentiates the homotopy through `autodiff` to build the augmented
Jacobian.
