# Pin Python to < 3.14 due to stack overflow detection bug in Python 3.14
# See: https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl/issues/694
# Python 3.14 introduced a buggy stack overflow detection mechanism that causes
# false positives with negative memory values when interacting with Julia's task system.
