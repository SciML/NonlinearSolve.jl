# [Steady State Solvers](@id ss_solvers)

`solve(prob::SteadyStateProblem, alg; kwargs)`

Solves for the steady states in the problem defined by `prob` using the algorithm
`alg`. If no algorithm is given, a default algorithm will be chosen.

## Recommended Methods

Conversion to a NonlinearProblem is generally the fastest method. However, this will not
guarantee the preferred root (the stable equilibrium), and thus if the preferred root is
required, then it's recommended that one uses `DynamicSS`. For `DynamicSS`, often an
adaptive stiff solver, like a Rosenbrock or BDF method (`Rodas5` or `QNDF`), is a good way
to allow for very large time steps as the steady state approaches.

!!! note
    
    The SteadyStateDiffEq.jl methods on a `SteadyStateProblem` respect the time definition
    in the nonlinear definition, i.e., `u' = f(u, t)` uses the correct values for `t` as the
    solution evolves. A conversion of a `SteadyStateProblem` to a `NonlinearProblem`
    replaces this with the nonlinear system `u' = f(u, âˆž)`, and thus the direct
    `SteadyStateProblem` approach can give different answers (i.e., the correct unique
    fixed point) on ODEs with non-autonomous dynamics.

!!! note
    
    If you have an unstable equilibrium and you want to solve for the unstable equilibrium,
    then `DynamicSS` might converge to the equilibrium based on the initial condition.
    However, Nonlinear Solvers don't suffer from this issue, and thus it's recommended to
    use a nonlinear solver if you want to solve for the unstable equilibrium.

## Full List of Methods

### Conversion to NonlinearProblem

Any `SteadyStateProblem` can be trivially converted to a `NonlinearProblem` via
`NonlinearProblem(prob::SteadyStateProblem)`. Using this approach, any of the solvers from
the [Nonlinear System Solvers page](@ref nonlinearsystemsolvers) can be used. As a
convenience, users can use:

  - `SSRootfind`: A wrapper around `NonlinearSolve.jl` compliant solvers which converts
    the `SteadyStateProblem` to a `NonlinearProblem` and solves it.

### SteadyStateDiffEq.jl

SteadyStateDiffEq.jl uses ODE solvers to iteratively approach the steady state. It is a
very stable method for solving nonlinear systems,
though often computationally more expensive than direct methods.

  - `DynamicSS` : Uses an ODE solver to find the steady state. Automatically terminates
    when close to the steady state. `DynamicSS(alg; tspan=Inf)` requires that an ODE
    algorithm is given as the first argument. The absolute and relative tolerances specify
    the termination conditions on the derivative's closeness to zero. This internally
    uses the `TerminateSteadyState` callback from the Callback Library. The simulated time,
    for which the ODE is solved, can be limited by `tspan`.  If `tspan` is a number, it is
    equivalent to passing `(zero(tspan), tspan)`.

Example usage:

```julia
using NonlinearSolve, SteadyStateDiffEq, OrdinaryDiffEq
sol = solve(prob, DynamicSS(Tsit5()))

using Sundials
sol = solve(prob, DynamicSS(CVODE_BDF()), dt = 1.0)
```

!!! note
    
    If you use `CVODE_BDF` you may need to give a starting `dt` via `dt=....`.
