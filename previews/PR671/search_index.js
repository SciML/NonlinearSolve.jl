The standard choice in the Levenberg-Marquardt method is to accept all steps that decrease the cost and reject all steps that increase the cost. Although this is a natural and safe choice, it is often not the most efficient. Therefore downhill moves are always accepted, but uphill moves are only conditionally accepted. To decide whether an uphill move will be accepted at each iteration i, we compute beta_i = cos(v_textnew v_textold), which denotes the cosine angle between the proposed velocity v_textnew and the velocity of the last accepted step v_textold. The idea is to accept uphill moves if the angle is small. To specify, uphill moves are accepted if (1-beta_i)^b_textuphill C_i+1 le C_i, where C_i is the cost at iteration i. Reasonable choices for b_uphill are 1.0 or 2.0, with b_uphill = 2.0 allowing higher uphill moves than b_uphill = 1.0. When b_uphill = 0.0, no uphill moves will be accepted. Defaults to 1.0.
